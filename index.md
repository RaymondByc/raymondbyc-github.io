## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="portrait.jpg">

Hi! I am working on HUAWEI company now! I still focus on the exciting field - Self Driving Cars and I have no doubts about its future prosperity. 

Specifically, I am involved in the Autonomous Valet Parking(AVP) with four surrounding cameras. I am responsible for the parking slot detection with bird-eye images, and the aid of localization with the related information with parking slot.   

We are in the hard but right way.

## Experiences

### Non-compliance Action Detection of Court Scene in Surveillance Videos  (2019.3 - Present)
As the team leader, I designed and led the entire project,  including  __a detection algorithm of the non-compliance actions in real-time__ and __the production of corresponding datasets__.   
The detection is divided into two stages.  Firstly, we use the __object detection__ algorithm to detect people and crop the corresponding area. 
Then we use the __image-based algorithm__ to process the easy-to-classify categories and __3D convolution network__ for more complex actions.

We won __2nd__ in the action recognition track of __Teda·Huabo cup innovation and entrepreneurship challenge__

### Extreme Low Resolution Action Recognition (2019.5 - Present)

In order to solve the problem that the target in the back corner of the court is too small, we proposed a new method to recognize extreme low-resolution activity.
we propose a novel Confident Spatial-Temporal Attention Transfer (CSTAT) for eLR activity recognition. __CSTAT can acquire information from high resolution data by reducing the attention differences with a transfer-learning strategy. Besides, the credibility of the supervisory signal is also taken into consideration for a more confident transferring process.__ Experimental results on two well-known datasets, i.e., UCF101 and HMDB51, demonstrate that, the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of eLR activity recognition, and achieves an accu- racy of 59.23% on 12×16 videos in HMDB51, __a state-of-the-art performance__.  

__The corresponding paper is submitted to IJCV.__

### 3D Semantic Reconstruction from a Monocular Camera with a Novel Multi-task Network (2018.8 - 2019.2)

This work was performed when  I studied at [Institute of Unmanned Systems @SYSU](https://www.usilab.cn/) as a summer research intern, under the supervision of [Prof.Chen](http://carlib.net/).   

We explore the interplay between low-level features for both depth and semantic prediction. The proposed network can produce __the depth and semantic maps simultaneously__, which provides basic knowledge for further semantic map reconstruction. We apply __image segmentation techniques__ to __refine the depth prediction__ to reduce the fluctuations caused by convolution layers. The final map is saved in __a memory-friendly way__ to present a large-scale urban scene.  

__The corresponding paper is accepted by IROS 2019.__

### SAR Image Despeckling with Fractional Total Variational Loss (2017.11 - 2018.5)
Motivated in __Applications in Fractional Calculus__ Course, we tried to apply fractional calculus to image denoising.   
In terms of __long-term memory, non-locality, and weak singularity,__ fractional differential of an image can preserve __the low-frequency contour feature in the smooth area, 
and non-linearly keep high-frequency edge information and texture information.__
We proposed __FID-CNN__ with a 8 layer CNN network to feature extraction and fractional total variational loss to preserve details of image. 
Ablation experiments were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.   

__The corresponding paper is accepted by International Conference on Intelligent Computing 2018.__
