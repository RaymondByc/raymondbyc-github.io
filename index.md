## Experiences

### Non-compliance Action Detection of Court Scene in Surveillance Videos  (March 2019 - Present)
As the team leader, I designed and led the entire project,  including  __a detection algorithm of the count non-compliance actions in real-time__ and __the production of corresponding datasets__.
The detection is divided into two stages.  
Firstly, we use the __object detection__ algorithm to detect people and crop the corresponding area. 
Then we use the __image-based algorithm__ to process the easy-to-classify categories and __3D convolution network__ for more complex actions.

We won __2nd__ in the action recognition track of __Teda·Huabo cup innovation and entrepreneurship challenge__

### Extreme Low Resolution Action Recognition (May 2019 -- Present)

In order to solve the problem that the target in the back corner of the court is too small, we proposed a new method to recognize __Extreme Low-Resolution Action}.__
We make full use of the __high-resolution information__ of __separate spatial and temporal features__ to promote low resolution recognition by __acquiring better attention__.
Experiments show that our proposed method can improve LR recognition accuracy __up to 4.4%__. The results achieve __ state-of-the-art performance__ on 12*16 HMDB51.\\

__The corresponding paper is submitted to AAAI 2020.__

### 3D Semantic Reconstruction from a Monocular Camera with a Novel Multi-task Network (August 2018 - February 2019)
We explore the interplay between low-level features for both depth and semantic prediction.  
The proposed network can produce __the depth and semantic maps simultaneously__, which provides basic knowledge for further semantic map reconstruction.    
We apply __image segmentation techniques__ to __refine the depth prediction__ to reduce the fluctuations caused by convolution layers.   
The final map is saved in __a memory-friendly way__ to present a large-scale urban scene.  

__The corresponding paper is recently submitted to the IROS 2019.__   

### SAR Image Despeckling with Fractional Total Variational Loss (November 2017 - May 2018)
Motivated in __\<Fractional Calculus Application\>__ Course, we tried to apply fractional calculus to image denoising.   
In terms of __long-term memory, non-locality, and weak singularity,__ fractional differential of an image can preserve __the low-frequency contour feature in the smooth area, 
and non-linearly keep high-frequency edge information and texture information.__
We proposed __FID-CNN__ with a 8 layer CNN network to feature extraction and fractional total variational loss to preserve details of image. 
Ablation experiments were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.   

__The corresponding paper is accepted by International Conference on Intelligent Computing 2018.__
